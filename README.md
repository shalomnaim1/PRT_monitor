# PRT_monitor
In this repository I developed a tool based on Flask to monitor my PRs status in PRT
This tool is relevant for users from RedHat QE which work on many PRs in the same time

How to use this tool:
  Simply run ```python app,py```
  If you have a list of PRs that you want to monitor create a file with the name ```pr_list.txt``` and place it in the
  same directory of ```app.py```, the file needs to contain a list of PR numbers
